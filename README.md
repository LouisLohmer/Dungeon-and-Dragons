# Dungeon&Dragons

## About the Project
This **Python-project** is a selfmade Dungeon&Dragons-program, which can be ran in your **IDE-Console**. Keep in mind that the console-messages and comments in the code are written in **german**, since i'am a german developer.

It works with the simplified but usual D&D-Rules, therefor each player (2 Players only) can choose at first between the characters knight, mage and villain. Then each character get the necessary stats, for example HP and initiative, and the character with the higher initiative gets the first move. After that it's at fight until death with alternate turns, of course there will be message in the console on which character died and which character won.

## Install Python
If your are **currently able to run Python files in your IDE, these steps wont be necessary for you**. Otherwise follow them in order to run my project:
1. Download the latest version of Python (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Download an IDE for your System (Windows, MAC, Linux), i personally use VSCode (https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
3. Install the Python-extension in your IDE to be able to actually run files in it. In VSCode just click on the Extensions-Button on the left drop-down-Menu, search "Python" and click on install.

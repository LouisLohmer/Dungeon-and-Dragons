# Dungeon&Dragons

## About the Project
This **Python-project** is a selfmade Dungeon&Dragons-program, which can be ran in your **IDE-Console**. Keep in mind that the console-messages and comments in the code are written in **german**, since i'am a german developer.

It works with the simplified but usual D&D-Rules, therefor each player (2 Players only) can choose at first between the characters knight, mage and villain. Then each character get the necessary stats, for example HP and initiative, and the character with the higher initiative gets the first move. After that it's at fight until death with alternate turns, of course there will be message in the console on which character died and which character won.

## Install Python
If your are **currently able to run Python files in your IDE, these steps wont be necessary for you**. Otherwise follow them in order to run my project:
1. Download the latest version of Python (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Download an IDE for your System (Windows, MAC, Linux), i personally use VSCode (https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
3. Install the Python-extension in your IDE to be able to actually run files in it. In VSCode just click on the Extensions-Button on the left drop-down-Menu, search "Python" and click on install.

## Run a python file in your IDE console
**If Python is installed correctly**, you should be able to run any python file. Each python file is labeled with **.py** at the end and the **python logo is displayed next to the file name**.
1. Open the specific python file you want to run, in our case it's Dungeon&Dragons.py
2. Klick on the run-icon of your IDE, in VSCode you can find it in the top right corner of the window (In the image below it's marked with a white border around it)
